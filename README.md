# Ajay D’Souza

I’ve been building WordPress plugins since 2005.

Not themes.  
Not SaaS wrappers.  
Plugins that run on your server, scale with traffic, and keep data where it belongs.

I care about correctness first, performance second, and configuration last.

---

## What I actually do

- Design plugin architectures that survive real traffic.
- Optimise MySQL queries instead of masking them.
- Build multisite-safe systems without special cases.
- Avoid external services unless they are genuinely required.
- Ship features slowly, but deliberately.

Most of my work lives at the uncomfortable intersection of:
WordPress, MySQL, performance, and long-term maintenance.

  Accurate post view tracking built for high-traffic sites and multisite networks.

## Beyond plugins

I run **Beyond Develop Ltd.**, a WordPress agency focused on:

- Custom plugin development
- Performance audits and fixes
- Multisite architecture
- Long-term maintenance, not one-off builds

## Writing & documentation

I write to explain *why* something exists, not just *how* it works.

- Blog: https://ajaydsouza.com  
- Plugin docs & deep dives: https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/

## Technical preferences (earned, not trendy)

- PHP with WordPress Coding Standards
- Explicit SQL over magical abstractions
- FULLTEXT indexes where they make sense
- REST APIs that respect cache layers
- Filters and actions added intentionally, not defensively
